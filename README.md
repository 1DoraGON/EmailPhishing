# EmailPhishing 
> This is ZedKi7 Branch
- I done some work on Enron Dataset, which has 500K row
- I'm including here some scrpits that used on this dataset
- And also a jupyter notebook that contains the steps on how to convert these emails to an organized csv file

- **rename_files.py**: i used this script to convert the extension of the files from (filename.)into (filename.txt)
- **txtFiles2csv.py**: i used this script to loop through all the files and convert them into csv
- **enron_dataset.ipynb**: all the work is here where i extract the columns from the emails and some other work
